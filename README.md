Website content for http://osmgb.org.uk  which Harry Wood runs on his server.

Currently this is just a holding page for the [OSMGB organisation](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSMGB) (a Nottingham university project) which has largely been wound down. We can change the holding page to have a link to a new OSMUK website (somewhere?)

...or we could even change this page to *be* a new website for the OpenStreetMap GB organisation, if we chose to name it that way. The OSMGB org folks likely will not mind us repurposing the osmgb.org.uk site in this way. They may require us to keep some sort of reference/credit to the old project, but... maybe not even that. Finally, but importantly, they current own the domain name and just point it to Harry's server, but they likely will be happy to hand over ownership of the domain name if we choose to use it (currently in [Steven Feldman](https://twitter.com/stevenfeldman)'s name)
